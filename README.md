# LinkedIn Tango Solver

A simple yet powerful browser extension to automatically solve the Tango puzzles found on LinkedIn minigames.

## Features

- **One-Click Solving**: Solve any Tango puzzle on a LinkedIn page instantly by clicking the extension icon.
- **Automatic Detection**: Intelligently reads the grid, including pre-filled suns and moons, and all horizontal/vertical constraints (`=` or `X`).
- **Clear Solutions**: The solution (suns and moons) is filled directly into the puzzle's empty cells.
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: On-screen notifications let you know the status of the solver (e.g., "Solving...", "Puzzle Solved!", or if an error occurs).
